<p>I got the jakle server working locally on my groupâ€™s repository and my persinal repository. I wored on learning python better for my role in the group as the back end dev so I made a project and worked with dicanarys. Jeffry is our dev ops trey is our frount end and johnathan is our scrub master. Our plan for our project is to make a web site where users can post chapters to their own web novels and read others web novels.</p>

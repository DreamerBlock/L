description: This week's work
---

This week has been the most productive one yet. I finished up my coin fliping code learning how to use for loops to repet my code as manytimes as I wanted. I also learned how to make my website dark mode, which is just way better than light mode, and how to use html to make a table on my home page. This week was also when I started development on my "Game" which is just a way for me to learn python better and make something fun. In the proces of making this I learned to make a info data storage, how to use global variables, and how to use while loops to run functions when I wanted them to run.

# Notice that relational operators can even work on lists!
# For lists, the relational operator compares each respective component until an answer is derived

print("['a','b','c'] > ['x','y','z']:", ['a','b','c'] > ['x','y','z'])
print("[1,2,3,5] > [1,2,3,4]:", [1,2,3,5] > [1,2,3,4])
print("[1,2,3,5] < [1,2,3,4]:", [1,2,3,5] < [1,2,3,4])
print("[1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4]:", [1,2,3,5] == [1,2,3,4])

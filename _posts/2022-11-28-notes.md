description: Whats a Variable?
---
Variables hold data in the the code. 
Types of variables:
- ints
- string
- floats
- doubles
- boulen

Dont make too comlex because it would be to hard to read keep it in a consitant format that you can reconize easly.
No spaces!

Int
whole numbers
x = 1

Floats
decimal numbers to a limit
x = 1.0001

doubles
unlimited decimals in a number
x = 1.0000000000000000000000000000000001

string
Is just a word
x = "Yo" or x = 'yo'

boulien
True or False
x = True

list
A list can be used to make variables more easy to format and store in your code as well as better use of them.
x = ["y", "k", "o"]

Asingments
Alows you to change a variable in a code.



Data Abstraction
used to represnt data in a useful form
- List
- Eliments
- Index
- String

List is the whole thing
eliments value in a string
Index the place of a eliment in a list starts at 0

How To add Elements to a List in Python
append() : append the element to the end of the list.
insert() : inserts the element before the given index.
extend() : extends the list by appending elements from the iterable.
List Concatenation: We can use the + operator to concatenate multiple lists and create a new list.

managing complexity makes it better to read update and convert the data.

colorlist=["green", "red", "pink", "purple", "blue", "brown"]

for i in colorlist:
    print(i)

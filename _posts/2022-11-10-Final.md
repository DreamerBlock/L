I got a 50/50 on the test and it was throgh the power of colaberation. I had to learn binary counting mid test by seeing the different numebrs and now I can count in bianary. 0 1 10 11 100 101 110 111 1000 1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111 10000 10001 10010 10011 10100 10101 10110 10111 11000 11001 11010 11011 11100 11101 11110 11111 extra. You start with zero then add a one if the bit is all ones then you add another bit and put a one on the left. Then you add a one on the right move it over one bit then add another one. Then you take all the ones next to eachother and put a one at the end of their line and turn them all back to 0's. Then you keep doing that till you fill the bits with ones and clear it all add a bit and then put the one on the left. If you want to make one bit numbers into more bit you can add leading zeros as they do nothing. I also leaned that the coding language in the test is ones based whitch is very sad. Also the 50 questions are not 0-49 so I am disapontied as a fellow coder. Most of the questions were just math or follow the number.
